# Hexagon Wonderland

> Welcome to the Hexagon Wonderland!

[Based on this!](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) but ✨Pythonic✨*!* 

## Requirements
- [`pip install -r requirements.txt`](https://www.python.org/)
  - [regenerate with `uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
  - [`typing_extensions`](https://pypi.org/project/typing_extensions/) if you aren't running Python 3.11 because `Self` took far too long to add into the language.
